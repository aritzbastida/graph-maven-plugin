  There are free, stable, and mature, executables for Linux, Mac, Solaris, and Windows available for download from {{{http://www.graphviz.org/}http://www.graphviz.org/}} 

* Example Graphs

  * {{{./graph/examples/1.png}Graph #1}} shows dependencies on logging libraries used by this plugin
  
  * {{{./graph/examples/2.png}Graph #2}} is the same graph drawn in FLAT mode with duplicate dependencies being displayed.
  
  * {{{./graph/examples/3.png}Graph #3}} is the complete transitive dependency tree for this plugin (aka "the transitive closure")  

    [[a]] This is the default type of graph produced by the plugin when no customizations are applied.
       
    [[a]] Dependences are styled according to their scope and optional settings.
      
    [[a]] Any spots in the tree where Maven conflict resolution replaced a dependency are highlighted with a red line labeled "conflict"  

  * {{{./graph/examples/4.png}Graph #4}} is the transitive closure but with conflicts displayed via the "showConflicts" flag  

+--
mvn graph:dependencies -Dgraph.showConflicts=true
+--   
  
  * The {{{./dependency-graphs.html}Dependency Graphs}} report has a more comprehensive set of examples. 
  
* Plugin Documentation

  * {{{./plugin-info.html}Plugin goals}} support generating a single graph, multiple graphs, and generating a report during Maven site generation.
