  There are free, stable, and mature executables for Linux, Mac, Solaris and Windows available for download from {{{http://www.graphviz.org/}http://www.graphviz.org/}} 

* Example Graphs

  * {{{./graph/logging/klog/linked.png}Graph #1}} shows dependencies on logging libraries used by this plugin
  
  * {{{./graph/logging/klog/flat.png}Graph #2}} is the same graph drawn in FLAT mode with duplicate dependencies being displayed.
  
  * {{{./graph/transitive/all/linked.png}Graph #3}} is the complete transitive closure for the dependencies of this plugin.  

    [[a]] This is the default type of graph produced by the plugin when no customizations are applied.
       
    [[a]] Dependences are styled according to their scope and optional settings.
      
    [[a]] Anywhere Maven's conflict resolution logic decides to replace a dependency is highlighted with a red line labeled "conflict"  
  
  * The {{{./dependency-graphs.html}Dependency Graphs}} report has a more comprehensive set of examples. 
  
* Plugin Documentation
