  There are mature, stable binaries for Linux, Mac, Solaris and Windows available for download from the {{{http://www.graphviz.org/}Graphviz website}} 

* Example Graphs

  * {{{./graph/logging/slf4j/linked.png}Graph #1}} shows dependencies on logging libraries used by this plugin
  
  * {{{./graph/logging/slf4j/flat.png}Graph #2}} is the same graph drawn in FLAT mode 
  
  * {{{./graph/transitive/all/linked.png}Graph #3}} is the default graph produced by this plugin.  It is the complete transitive closure for the dependencies of a project with styling for scope/optional.  If Maven's conflict resolution logic replaces a dependency it is highlighted with a red line labeled "conflict"  
  
  * The {{{./dependency-graphs.html}Dependency Graphs}} report has a more comprehensive set of examples. 
  
* Plugin Documentation

  * {{{./plugin-info.html}Plugin goals}} support generating a single graph, multiple graphs, and generating a report during Maven site generation.
