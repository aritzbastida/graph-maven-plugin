  There are free, mature, stable, executables for Linux, Mac, Solaris and Windows available at {{{http://www.graphviz.org/}http://www.graphviz.org/}} 

* Example Graphs

  * {{{./graph/logging/slf4j/linked.png}Graph #1}} shows dependencies on logging libraries used by this plugin
  
  * {{{./graph/logging/slf4j/flat.png}Graph #2}} is the same graph drawn in FLAT mode 
  
  * {{{./graph/transitive/all/linked.png}Graph #3}} is the complete transitive closure for the dependencies of this plugin.  This is the default type of graph produced by the plugin when no customizations are applied.   Dependences are styled according to their scope and optional settings.  Anywhere Maven's conflict resolution logic replaces a dependency it is highlighted with a red line labeled "conflict"  
  
  * The {{{./dependency-graphs.html}Dependency Graphs}} report has a more comprehensive set of examples. 
  
* Plugin Documentation

  * {{{./plugin-info.html}Plugin goals}} support generating a single graph, multiple graphs, and generating a report during Maven site generation.
