/**
 * <p>
 * This mojo produces customizable graphs of Maven dependency trees.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, the complete dependency tree (including transitive dependencies) is graphed. Graphs can be filtered with
 * include/exclude criteria for artifacts and with show/hide criteria for Maven <code>scope</code> and
 * <code>optional</code> settings.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Two layout styles are supported - <code>LINKED</code> and <code>FLAT</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In <code>LINKED</code> mode, the relationships between shared dependencies are shown. Each dependency included in the
 * build is displayed on the graph only once. The connections between dependencies are presented by Graphviz algorithms
 * as a directed hierarchical graph.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For a transitive dependency, <code>LINKED</code> mode illustrates why Maven includes it in the build.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For a shared dependency (eg commons-logging), <code>LINKED</code> mode shows what other libraries depend on it.
 * <code>LINKED</code> mode also shows the decisions Maven makes when resolving conflicts between pom's that depend on
 * different versions of the same artifact.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In <code>FLAT</code> mode, dependencies are displayed exactly how they are defined in the pom's. This style can make
 * it easier to comprehend the dependency tree but relationships between shared dependencies are not drawn.
 * </p>
