 * <p>
 * This mojo produces customizable graphs of Maven dependency trees.

 *
 * <p>
 * By default, the complete dependency tree (including transitive dependencies) is graphed. Graphs can be filtered with
 * include/exclude criteria for artifacts (eg -Dgraph.includes=org.apache.*) and with show/hide criteria for Maven
 * <code>scope</code> and <code>optional</code> settings (eg -Dgraph.show=compile,runtime)
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Two layout styles are supported. In <code>CONDENSED</code> mode, relationships between shared dependencies are
 * included in the graph. In <code>FLAT</code> mode, dependencies are displayed how they are defined in pom's.
